DAY ONE

MY NAME IS... I work here at OU in their IT department specifically on the website one.ou.edu

so far you have been coding and displaying in a window on your computer or console on your computer using c#. 

So you have been doing console applications or very simple WPF applications
While that is great and all for learning coding concepts, it is now how we really use computers in the real world.

Real world you usually have code running on a server out on the internet and you use a web browser to access and display information.

The browser is your console/wpf display.  

Traditionally it looks somethign like this:

SLIDE SHOW

<TAKE TIME AND SHOW BOTH SITES INSPECTION TOOLS>  ONE VS NEW ONE



<SLIDES NOT TYPESAFE>

Show code loading and cannot find element

First event is "DOMContentLoaded"  ->  This could execute like a main() and auto raised when DOM is fully parsed, built and ready to access.

write functions to handle the events and they are called

Coding is easy, you have to know the capability of what you want to do and then just google how to do it.

So, think of what you want done, then google your way through it!


const, let, var and examples, type === and == examples:
if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5
if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y);

Different ways to do stuff.  getElementById, getElementsByClass, getElementsByType...

onclick and click = ways to wire up.

show .boxDiv in CSS  or button {} in css etc

IMPORTANT THING TO NOTE:  Not specifics of how to do things.  instead how to google what you want and apply it to your project


show TOP and LEFT with 0 and 50 then change to 0 and 50px!

TRY MOUSEOVER THEN MOUSEMOVE

*** SHOW
function mouseDown() {
  myObject.moveDiv = !myObject.moveDiv
  console.log(myObject.moveDiv);
}

myObject = {};

myObject.foo = document.getElementsByClassName("boxDiv")[0];
myObject.foo.onmousedown = mouseDown;

function mouseDown() {
  console.log("mousedown");
}


function clickAction() {
  console.log(myObject);
  myObject.foo.style.backgroundColor = "red";
}


can  move button to top by inline-block and vertical-align top

Asynchronous is huge in JS.  
block is bad
