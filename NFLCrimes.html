	Hi Steve.  Work for OU, I write one.ou.edu.  new version written in Angular 8 soon.
	So for some of you this semester between all your classes you're learning a bunch of differe t languages,
	SQL, vbasic, c# and now javascript!  I'm going to purposely go slow because I want everyone to follow
	what I'm doing and not be lost.  STOP me, ask questions if you are not with me.  I don't know what you don't
	know so if you don't stop me you may be lost.  Chances are if you dont know someone else doesnt either.  I will stop and
	call on some of you to answer a question to make sure you are following! :):w

	slides: sometimes its good to stop and just think about what is going on...
	www: where is your code running?  why important?  need to make requests for data and
	BE vs FE is much different!
talk about oclient server and javascript on client
servers vs browsers
all calls take a while
block = bad
Talk about async programming
